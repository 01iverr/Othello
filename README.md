# Othello
## Project description
We made a 1-player version of Othello(/Reversi) for terminal, in which the computer calculates the optimal move using the Minimax Algorithm. 
The game was made as part of a project for our University lesson "Artificial Inteligence".

### Details
* The difficulty is decided by the player at the start of the game, specifically, it determines the depth of the tree used by the MiniMax algorithm. 
* The player may choose whether to play first or not
* The games ends when either the board is full, or neither side can make a move
